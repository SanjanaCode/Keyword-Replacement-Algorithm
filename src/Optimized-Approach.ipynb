I can only see the top tip of each channel number and cannot make out the numbers themselves. The Pixel Home Bar is overlapping all of the numbers. This happens on both portrait and landscape modes. Is there a setting I modified that may be causing this? Hope this input helps in improving the interface. Cheers!\n",
