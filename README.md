# Keyword-Replacement-Algorithm

This repository contains the source code for two versions of the keyword replacement algorithm. The algorithm is used to replace common abbreviations and keywords with their full form. The algorithm is implemented in python.

The first version of the algorithm uses a brute force technique to replace the common abbreviations and keywords with their full form. The second version of the algorithm uses a avl tree data structure to store the common abbreviations and keywords. The algorithm then takes in each tweet and seraches for the abbreviations in the AVL tree and replaces them with their full form, if it finds any matches. The algorithm then returns the tweet list with the abbreviations replaced with their full form.

The second algorithm uses the AVL tree data structure to store the common abbreviations and keywords. The algorithm then takes in each tweet and seraches for the abbreviations in the AVL tree and replaces them with their full form, if it finds any matches. The algorithm then returns the tweet list with the abbreviations replaced with their full form.
