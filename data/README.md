# Datasets

**Note**: we were not able to directly upload the datasets to github due to the large size of the files.

To obtain our datasets, please download them from the following links:

- [tweets.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IWGORYZsUdT4tLhngU_JhC_ym4otKJyL/view)
- [common-abb-keyword.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y8ht9fcp6G0hBPbeM0wQic9A7UEdYQZO/view)

Please download the data sets to the data folder located the Keyword-Replacement-Algorithm folder. Once the datasets are downloaded into the data folder, you can run the algortihm without having to change the file path inside the code.
