# Datasets

**Note**: we were not able to directly upload the datasets to github due to the large size of the files.

To obtain our datasets, please download them from the following links:

- [tweets.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IWGORYZsUdT4tLhngU_JhC_ym4otKJyL/view)
- [common-abb-keyword.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QIMpB_d6KXYxytjOy9f9IaNK0gAQGduW/view?usp=sharing)

Once you have downloaded the datasets, please download it to the data folder in the Keyword-Replacement-Algorithm folder. You can the run the code in the Naive-Approach file without any further changes. The code will automatically read the datasets from the data folder.
